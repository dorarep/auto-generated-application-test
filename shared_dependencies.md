Shared Dependencies:

1. **OpenAI API**: Used in "src/services/openaiAPI.ts" for making requests to the OpenAI API. This service is imported and used in "src/components/MVVConversion.tsx" to convert business ideas into an MVV framework.

2. **MVVConversion Component**: Defined in "src/components/MVVConversion.tsx" and used in "src/pages/index.tsx". This component is responsible for receiving user input and displaying the converted MVV framework.

3. **MVV Type**: Defined in "src/types/index.ts" and used in "src/components/MVVConversion.tsx" and "src/services/openaiAPI.ts". This type represents the structure of the MVV framework.

4. **Global Styles**: Defined in "src/styles/global.css" and used across all components, including the MVVConversion component and the main page in "src/pages/index.tsx".

5. **Next.js Configurations**: Defined in "next.config.js" and used across the application for server-side rendering and routing.

6. **TypeScript Configurations**: Defined in "tsconfig.json" and used across all TypeScript files for type checking and improved developer experience.

7. **Package.json**: Contains all the dependencies and scripts for the application. It's shared across all the files as it manages the packages that the files depend on.

8. **DOM Elements**: The MVVConversion component may contain DOM elements with specific id names that are used in the component's JavaScript functions. These id names are shared between the component's TypeScript and CSS files.

9. **Function Names**: Functions defined in "src/services/openaiAPI.ts" like `convertToMVV` are used in "src/components/MVVConversion.tsx". Similarly, functions defined in "src/components/MVVConversion.tsx" like `handleIdeaSubmission` are used in "src/pages/index.tsx".

10. **Message Names**: Any messages or events used for communication between components or services would be shared. For example, a 'conversionComplete' message might be emitted by the OpenAI service and listened for in the MVVConversion component.
